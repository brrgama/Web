        <!--The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.-->
        <!--There are two main attributes to go with the <img> tag: src (the source of the image) and alt (an alternative text for the image. This attribute has tree main functions: It shows the attribute value in case the image is not correctly load, it helps search engines to know what the image is, and it interacts with softwares for people with visual deficiency).-->
        <!--An option to show an image is by using a link from another web page, like Example 01.-->
        <!--Another possibility to show an image is by adding it to a folder inside the domain and referencing it, like Example 02.-->
        <!--It is possible to change the width and the height of the image, like Example 03. But it is important to note that it is not a good idea to do this using the HTML, the CSS is the file used for formatting the page.-->
