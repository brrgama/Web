        <!--The use of the tag <b> turns the text to bold, the visual aspect of the use of the tag <strong> is the same. The difference between those two tags is that the tag <strong> indicates that the sentence or the word is important, therefore, it highlights the text semantically. The tag <b> only makes the text bold, therefore, it only draws attention to the text, without any interference on the semantic of the word/phrase. -->
        <!--The use of the tag <i>, turns the text into italic. The tag <em> stands for emphasis and have the same visual aspect. The difference between the two tags is the same for the <b> and <strong> tags. The tag <em> have more semantic than the tag <i>.-->
        <!--The tag <mark> defined text that should be marked, the same visual aspect as a text marker.-->
        <!--The tag <small> makes the text small.-->
        <!--The tag <sub> makes a subscript text. Therefore, the text appears half a character below the normal line.-->
        <!--The tag <sup> defined superscript text. Like the <sub> tag, in this case, the text appears half a character above the normal line.-->
        <!--The <del> tag defines the text that has been deleted from a document. The <ins> tag defined a new text that has been inserted into a document.-->
        <!--The <br> tag is a self-closing tag that inserts a single line break. It can be useful for writing poems. It is important to notice that this tag must be used to enter line breaks, not to add space between paragraphs.-->
