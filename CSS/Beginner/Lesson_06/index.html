    <h2>Sans-Serife</h2>

    <div class="sans-serif">
        <p>In typography and lettering, a sans-serif, sans serif, gothic, or simply sans letterform is one that does not have extending features called "serifs" at the end of strokes. Sans-serif typefaces tend to have less stroke width variation than serif typefaces. They are often used to convey simplicity and modernity or minimalism.</p>
    </div>
    

    <h2>Serife</h2>

    <div class="serif">
        <p>In typography, a serif is a small line or stroke regularly attached to the end of a larger stroke in a letter or symbol within a particular font or family of fonts. A typeface or "font family" making use of serifs is called a serif typeface (or serifed typeface), and a typeface that does not include them is sans-serif. Some typography sources refer to sans-serif typefaces as "grotesque" (in German, grotesk) or "Gothic", and serif typefaces as "roman".</p>
    </div>
    

    <h2>Monospace</h2>

    <div class="monospace">
        <p>A monospaced font, also called a fixed-pitch, fixed-width, or non-proportional font, is a font whose letters and characters each occupy the same amount of horizontal space.This contrasts with variable-width fonts, where the letters and spacings have different widths.</p>
