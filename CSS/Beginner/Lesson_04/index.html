    <h1>About Lengths for Font-Size</h1>

    <p>The root element (<strong>HTML</strong> element) have 16 pixels, as can be confirmed with the inspect tool from the browser. It is also possible to change the font-size of any element, including the HTML element.</p>

    <p class="example0">It is possible to set the font-size of an element to be proportional to the root element with the unit <strong>rem</strong>, as this very paragraph. Therefore, the text from this paragraph will have 2*16 = 32 pixels. </p>

    <div class="container">
        <p class="example1">Here is an example of setting the font-size property to 50 pixels.</p>
        <p class="example2">Here is an example of inheriting the font-size from the parent element, which is 25 pixels.</p>
        <p class="example3">Here is an example where it is used the <strong>em</strong> unit to determine the font-size. Since the inherit font-size is 25px, and it is used 2em as the font-size of this element class, the text must have 50px.</p>
    </div>
