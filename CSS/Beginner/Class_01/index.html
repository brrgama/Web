    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p>The style (including the design, layout and variations for different devices and screen sizes) of a web page is defined with the CSS language. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it describes how all HTML elements will appear on the screen. With the CSS one can have control of multiple web pages all at once.</p>

    <h2>CSS inline</h2>
    <p>The most simple way of inserting and using CSS in the HTML code is by the called inline insertion. This method must be used to apply a unique style for a single element. To use inline style, the style attribute must be added to the HTML element. In this attribute, one can change a property of this element by editing its value. </p>
    <p style="color:red;">To change the color of a paragraph, for example, inside the <i>p</i> tag, it must be inserted the <em>style</em> attribute with the <em>color</em> property receiving the desired value (in this case, the color), for example, red, like this paragraph.</p>
    <p style="background-color:blue;">There are tons of properties that can be edited within the <i>style</i> attribute, another example is presented in this paragraph with the <em>backgroun-color</em> property, that defines the background color of the element content. </p>
    <p style="color:yellow;background-color: crimson;">Finally, one can define multiples properties in the same HTML element, like defining the color oh the text and the background color as well, like this paragraph. To define multiple properties, each property must be separated by a semicolon (;).</p>
