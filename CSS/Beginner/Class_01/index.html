    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <div>
        <p style="color: black; background-color:white">The style (including the design, layout and variations for different devices and screen sizes) of a web page is defined with the CSS language. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it describes how all HTML elements will appear on the screen. With the CSS one can have control of multiple web pages all at once.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h2>Inline CSS</h2>
        <p style="color:black; background-color:white">The most simple way of inserting and using CSS in the HTML code is by the called inline insertion. This method must be used to apply a unique style for a single element. To use inline style, the style attribute must be added to the HTML element. In this attribute, one can change a property of this element by editing its value. </p>
        <p style="color:red; background-color:white;">To change the color of a paragraph, for example, inside the <i>p</i> tag, it must be inserted the <em>style</em> attribute with the <em>color</em> property receiving the desired value (in this case, the color), for example, red, like this paragraph.</p>
        <p style="color: black; background-color:blue;">There are tons of properties that can be edited within the <i>style</i> attribute, another example is presented in this paragraph with the <em>backgroun-color</em> property, that defines the background color of the element content. </p>
        <p style="color:yellow;background-color: crimson;">Finally, one can define multiples properties in the same HTML element, like defining the color oh the text and the background color as well, like this paragraph. To define multiple properties, each property must be separated by a semicolon (;).</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Internal CSS</h2>
        <p>An internal style may be useful if the hole HTML page has a unique style. To define de internal style, the tag &ltstyle&gt must be used inside the head section, like this example. The use of this type of style is also advantagous if it is necessary to change the style of many places in the HTML code, this type facilitates the changing in the whole page. In this mode, the CSS selector must be used to select the HTML element(s) must be styled. </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>External CSS</h2>        
        <p>Even with the addition of internal CSS in this main page (index.html), secondary pages will not maintain the changes of style defined previously. In the external style sheet, it is possible to change the look of an entire website by changing only one file. It is necessary the use of the &ltlink&gt element in the head section to include a reference to the external style (style.css). Also in this mode, the CSS selector is used to select the HTML element(s) to be styled.</p>
